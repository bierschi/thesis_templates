\chapter{Topic: Quote}


\section{Citation}

Here i quote from a particular book: This quote is from one special book that i have to specify in the end. There are even two books, just so you see that \cite{Williams201205,Siegert200612}


Legislative texts, for example, need not to be quoted. Here is enough a reference in the footnote \footnote{This is the super footnote, here is something of BGB §§12 Abs. 3 Satz 4}
